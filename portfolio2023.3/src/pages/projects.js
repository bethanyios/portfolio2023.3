    <h1>Shannon Trust & The Ministry of Justice. </h1>
    <p>UX Designer & Researcher, App Development (2021 - present)</p>
    <p>Turning Pages is for prison leavers on probation who use it to continue or start learning how to read. Shannon Trust has provided a reading intervention program in prisons for over 20 years, using manual books and peer learning.

Over 50% of adult prisoners in the UK are illiterate, making it a critical social and equality issue. Thanks to the Trust's efforts, 90% of its learners pursue further education. The Ministry of Justice's initiative to reduce reoffending rates provided funding to digitize the program into an app.</p>

<p>My research & design objectives:
<br />• convert the reading exercises into usable digital formats with developers and stakeholders
<br />• conduct usability testing remotely and in-prison using varied methods
<br />• gather insights to identify how different learning approaches for non-readers can be adapted for self-study
<br />• lead on the audio production with research into the accessibility
<br />• run a longitudinal diary study for a community rollout and create reusable white label apps to be used by various organisations
</p>
<p>"Turning Pages will be piloted with 300 prison leavers with self-assessed low literacy across the Kent, Surrey and Sussex probation region." - gov.uk</p>

    <p>
      Administrator for the HR team in a mental health charity rooted in service-user involvement. The head office takes care of around 600 employees from services all over the UK. This job involved interacting and supporting staff and managers regularly, as well as minute taking for disciplinaries.

    <h1>Shannon Trust & The Ministry of Justice. </h1>
    <strong><p>UX Designer & Researcher, App Development (2021 - present)</p></strong>
    <p>Turning Pages is for prison leavers on probation learning how to read. Shannon Trust has provided a reading intervention program in prisons for over 20 years, using manual books and peer learning. </p>
    <p>Over 50% of adult prisoners in the UK are illiterate, making it a critical social and equality issue. Thanks to the Trust's efforts, 90% of its learners pursue further education. The Ministry of Justice's initiative to reduce reoffending rates provided funding to digitise the program into an app.</p> 
    <p>My work involved converting reading exercises into digital formats through collaboration with developers and stakeholders. I conducted usability testing both remotely and within prisons to gather insights on tailoring the learning approaches for non-readers and self-study. I led audio production, prioritising accessibility. Since launch, I have created a longitudinal diary study for community rollout to develop a whitelabel tool for a range of organisations that would benefit.</p>
    <p>"Turning Pages will be piloted with 300 prison leavers with self-assessed low literacy across the Kent, Surrey and Sussex probation region." - gov.uk</p>
      
    <h1>Social Mobility Foundation. </h1>
    <strong><p>UX Designer & Project Manager, Website & Application Form Development (2022-present)</p></strong>
    <p>The Social Mobility Foundation approached Yalla to digitally transform their organisation. As well as the UX designer, I was tasked with serving as the overall Project Manager, a welcome challenge for me and an opportunity to develop management skills.</p>
    <p>In my designer role, I revamped the student application form to enhance conversion rates and redesigned the Employer Index Report webpage, catering to high-level corporations aiming to grasp their social mobility impact. I ran weekly co-design sessions with young users to facilitate continuous feedback collection, as well as design thinking workshops with stakeholders.
      I was the lead on usability testing and from here compiled synthesis documentation of the findings. </p>
    <p>At the launch of a campaign by Social Mobility Foundation, through Google Analytics, they witnessed a record-breaking influx of applicants within 24 hours - a testament to the efficacy of the user-centred design approach I implemented which aimed to improve conversion rates.</p>
    <p>We are currently in the second phase of work with this client and are working on their new website to transform their digital presence. This has brought complex challenges both as designer and project manager.</p>
    
    <h1> The Scouts Association. </h1>
    <strong><p>UX Designer, App Development (2022 - present) </p></strong>
    <p>The Scouts Association wanted to improve the digital skills of their volunteers. Through many iterations I designed and test the tool and now manage the maintenance post launch.</p>
    <p>From a basic tool to access tutorials, the tool has evolved with a personalisation assessment to gauge what level the learner. Further developments incorporated "Digital Champions" who can support by directly answering questions or mentoring. Throughout the process volunteers were involved in workshops through co-design as well as in usability testing I conducted for each sprint and iteration. This level of involvement has allowed this tool to be entirely user-centric and rooted in the needs of actual people. </p>
    <p>The tool has been awarded runner up in the Digital Leaders 100 Awards for Digital Skills or Talent Initiative of the Year (Product or Service) category. You can read more about the tool <a className="inline" href="https://www.scouts.org.uk/news/2023/july/let-s-talk-about-digital-skills-and-why-they-re-so-important/ " rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

    <h1> Chiltern Music Therapy.</h1>
    <strong><p>UX Designer, Website Development (2022)</p></strong>
    <p>Chiltern Music Therapy website was transformed to enhance their digital presence and provide better access to their various therapy offerings.</p>
    <p>I established website goals and KPIs in collaboration with the client and formulated testable hypotheses. Once that was defined, I orchestrated design thinking workshops creating user personas and service journey mapping which allowed me to build out user stories to form the site structure.  Additionally, I designed a user-friendly CMS using Webflow, empowering the client to seamlessly make updates and maintain the website.</p>
    <p>My findings showed it was key to focus on streamlining the enquiry process: triaging users through relevant flows such as "who we work with" and "where we work", to enable an intuitive journey through the site for their needs. The user story ends with a referral form where users can select the type of referral they require, creating a new and efficient backend for Chiltern to manage enquiries.</p>
    <p>“From responding to our brief, to in person workshops to bring the vision to life to finally a brand new shiny website, it was a hugely positive experience. The focus that Yalla have on the user when building a website really did set them apart. We are so happy with the website we now have and the ability we have to make changes ourselves and to request changes from the dev team makes everything so much easier to manage.” - Katie Shushter</p> 
    
    <h1> Trades Union Congress. </h1>
    <strong><p>UX Researcher & Facilitator, User Research (2023)</p></strong>
    <p>I conducted user research for the Trades Union Congress (TUC) regarding union member experiences with the cost of living crisis. It was a crucial endeavor to gain deep insights into the challenges faced by workers. 
       By engaging in qualitative interviews with members from various unions including the Royal Mail, I moderated research to gather firsthand narratives.</p>
    <p>The research will empower the TUC to advocate effectively for policy changes to address the needs and concerns of workers, ensuring that their voices are heard and their struggles acknowledged in the pursuit of creating a fair and sustainable economic landscape for all.</p>

    <h1>Together for Mental Wellbeing.</h1>
    <strong><p>HR Administrator (Jan - Oct 2019)</p></strong>
    <p>
      Administrator for the HR team in a mental health charity rooted in service-user involvement. The head office takes care of around 600 employees from services all over the UK. This job involved interacting and supporting staff and managers regularly, as well as minute taking for disciplinaries. This gave me the opportunity to learn about the functionality of a charity from within.  
    </p>
    <p>
       In addition, I contributed to the implementation of a new HR system which was incredibly insightful to be on the charity side of digital integrations. As a developer and UX designer, I have experience in their position which makes me conscious of their perspective.
